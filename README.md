LeetCode Q # 1290.

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.
